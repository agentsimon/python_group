<br>
<br>
1. Do you like treasure hunts? In this problem you are to write a
program to explore the above array for a treasure. The values in the
array are clues. Each cell contains an integer between 11 and 55; for
each value the ten's digit represents the row number and the unit's
digit represents the column number of the cell containing the next
clue. Starting in the upper left corner (at 1,1), use the clues to
guide your search of the array. (The first three clues are 11, 34, 42).
The treasure is a cell whose value is the same as its coordinates. Your
program must first read in the treasure map data into a 5 by 5 array.
Your program should output the cells it visits during its search, and a
message indicating where you found the treasure.<br>
<br>
<br>
2. Write a program to search for the "saddle points" in a 5 by 5 array
of integers. A saddle point is a cell whose value is 
greater than or equal to any in its row,
and less than or equal to any 
in its column. There may be more than one 
saddle point in the array. Print out the
coordinates of any saddle points your program finds.
Print out "No saddle points" if there are none.<br>
<br>
3. In the game of chess, a queen can attack pieces which are on the
same row, column, or diagonal. A chessboard can be represented by an 8
by 8 array. A 1 in the array represents a queen on the corresponding
square, and a O in the array represents an unoccupied square. Your
program is to read the location of two queens and then update the array
appropriately.&nbsp; Then process the board and indicate whether or not
the two queens are positioned so that they attack each other. <br>
<br>
4.&nbsp; One classic method for composing secret messages is called a
square code.&nbsp; The spaces are removed from the english text <br>
and the characters are written into a square (or rectangle).&nbsp; For
example, the sentence "If man was meant to stay on the <br>
ground god would have given us roots" is 54 characters long, so it is
written into a rectangle with 7 rows and 8 columns. <br>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ifmanwas<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; meanttos&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tayonthe<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; groundgo<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dwouldha<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vegivenu<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sroots<br></pre>
The coded message is obtained by reading down the columns going left to
right.&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, the message above is coded as:<br>
<br>
<tt>imtgdvs fearwer mayoogo anouuio ntnnlvt wttddes aohghn&nbsp; sseoau</tt><br>
<br>
In your program, have the user enter a message in english with no
spaces between the words.&nbsp; Have the maximum message length be 81 <br>
characters.&nbsp; Display the encoded message. (Watch out that no
"garbage" characters are printed.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here are some more
examples:<br>
<pre>&nbsp;Input&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Output<br>haveaniceday&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hae and via ecy<br>feedthedog&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fto ehg ee&nbsp; dd<br>chillout&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; clu hlt io<br></pre>

Write a program to do the following:<br>
<br>
a. Read the raw vote totals from a data file that contains one row for
each precinct.<br>
<br>
b. Display the table with appropriate headings for the rows and columns.<br>
<br>
c. Compute and display the total number of votes received by each
candidate and<br>
the percent of the total votes cast.<br>
<br>
d. If any one candidate received over 50% of the votes, the program
should print<br>
&nbsp;a message declaring that candidate the winner.<br>
<br>
e. If no candidate received 50% of the votes, the program should print
a message<br>
declaring a run-off between the two candidates receiving the highest
number of<br>
votes; the two candidates should be identified by their letter names.<br>
<br>
f. For testing, run the program with the above data, and also with
another<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; data file where Candidate C receives only 108 votes in
precinct 4.<br>

<h3><a name="moderate"></a>Moderate Problems</h3>
<br>
Write a program to find all the sentences, or consecutive sequence of
sentences, in a text file where:&nbsp; min &lt;= length &lt;= max.<br>
Assume that a sentence ends in a period, question mark, or exclamation
point.<br>
In the special case of quoted sentences (that begin with quotes or an
apostrophe), include the terminating quote mark or apostrophe.<br>
Count all blanks and punctuation, but assume only one blank between
sentences.<br>
(All EOL characters should be converted to blanks).<br>
Precondition: Min and Max will be positive integers less than 1000, and
Min &lt;= Max.<br>
The name of the text file is to be provided as a command line argument
(not read from Standard Input).<br>
<br>
For example, given this text:<br>
<tt>Black is white.&nbsp; Day is night.&nbsp; Understanding is
ignorance.<br>
Truth is fiction.&nbsp; Safety is danger.<br>
</tt><br>
If min = max = 16 then the output is <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "<tt>Black is white.</tt>"<br>
If min = max = 18 then the output is <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "<tt>Truth is fiction.</tt>"<br>
<tt>&nbsp; "Safety is danger.</tt>"<br>
If min = 30 and max = 37 then the output is <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "<tt>Truth is fiction.</tt><tt> Safety is danger.</tt>"<br>
because the two sentences are consecutive sentences with the desired
length.<br>

<h3><a name="PhoneWords"></a>Phone "words"</h3>
Each number on the telephone dial (except 0 and 1) corresponds to three
alphabetic characters. Those correspondences are:
<pre>&nbsp;2 ABC&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;3 DEF&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;4 GHI&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;5 JKL&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;6 MNO&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;7 PRS&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;8 TUV&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;9 WXY</pre>
Given a seven digit telephone number, print all 2187 possible "words"
that
number spells. (They may not be real english words, but just some
sequence
of characters). Since the digits 0 and 1 have no alphabetic equivalent,
an input number which contains those digits should be rejected. The
input
will be one or more seven digit integers from standard input.
<p>The problem can be made a bit more challenging by outputting more
than
one word per line. Usually about seven words will fit on a line.
</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="LetterPairs"></a>Frequency of letter pairs</h3>
Write a program to count the occurrences of all letter pairs in a
sample
of text (like the first paragraph of the Constitution). Disregard
differences
between lower and upper case letters. (Blanks are not considered as
letters).
Output the 100 most frequent letter pairs, in order by percent of
total.
Also show which percent of total pairs is accounted for by this list of
100. Your program should correctly process situations where the input
file
is empty or where less than 100 pairs occur.
<p>&nbsp;Sample output
</p>
<pre>th 2.37%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in 2.20%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fj 2.00%&nbsp; ...&nbsp; (6 per line)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (100 letter pairs)<br><br>Output represents 73.44% of 23641 letter pairs.</pre>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Subwords"></a>Computing "subword" combinations.</h3>
<p><br>
Accept any number of lines of input entered from standard input.
A valid line contains a word and a number. The word comes first, and is
up to twenty alphabetic characters (A-Z) in upper or lower case. The
word
may be preceeded and followed by any number of blanks. The number is a
decimal integer greater than zero, and may be followed by any number of
blanks or a return. Input is terminated by EOF character. For each
input
word, print all possible "subwords" that have as many characters as
specified
by the number. A "subword" is a n-letter word comprised of only
characters
that are found in the given word. If you are familiar with the game
Scrabble,
it's as though the input word is your pool of letters, and you want to
find all possible arrangements of n letters from your pool. .nf For
example,
CAT 2 would produce CA CT AC AT TA TC and DOG 1 would produce D O G and
BIRD 3 would produce BIR BID IRD RID DIR RIB ... Note, that we are
producing
combinations WITHOUT replacement, so in the BIRD 3 example, BBB and RRR
are NOT possible subwords. The output should echo the input line to
standard
output, followed by the list of subwords, one word per line, left
justified.
Each set of output words should be followed by one blank line. The
program
should respond to invalid input by echoing the input line to the
output,
and then issuing a one line message indicating the nature of the error:
</p>
<dir>
<dir>&nbsp;"Illegal character in word"
<p>&nbsp;"Illegal character in number"
</p>
<p>&nbsp;"Number greater than length of word"
</p>
<p>&nbsp;"Word longer than 20 characters"</p>
</dir>
</dir>
After issuing the message, processing should resume with the next input
line. When all input has been processed, issue a message indicating the
number of input words that were processed (including word with errors)
e.g., "End of input encountered, 4 words processed."

<h3><a name="BowlingScores"></a>Calculating bowling match scores</h3>
<p><br>
A bowling match consists of ten frames. Each frame except for the
tenth consists of one or two balls, or attempts to knock down the ten
pins
at the end of the alley. Doing so on the first ball of the frame is
called
a strike, and the second ball of the frame is not rolled. Knocking down
all ten pins with both balls (having left some up with the first ball)
is called a spare. If both attempts to knock down the pins leave some
standing,
the frame is called an open frame. A spare in the tenth frame gives the
bowler one extra ball; a strike in the tenth gives him or her two extra
balls. A bowling score is computed as follows. A strike counts as 10
points
plus the sum of the next two balls. A spare counts as 10 points plus
the
next ball. Any other balls merely count as themselves, as do any bonus
balls rolled as a result of a strike or a spare in the tenth frame.
Suppose
for example that the sequence of balls was
</p>
<pre>9 1&nbsp;&nbsp; 0 10&nbsp;&nbsp; 10&nbsp;&nbsp; 10&nbsp;&nbsp; 6 2&nbsp;&nbsp; 7 3&nbsp;&nbsp; 8 2&nbsp;&nbsp; 10&nbsp;&nbsp; 9 0&nbsp;&nbsp; 9 1&nbsp;&nbsp; 10</pre>
The score for the ten frames would be
<pre>Frame&nbsp;&nbsp; score<br>-----&nbsp;&nbsp; -----&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 30&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 56&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 74&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 82&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 100&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 120&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 139&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 148&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 168<br><br><br><br></pre>
Write a program to accept from standard input the scores for a sequence
of balls and output the scores for the ten frames. There may be
multiple
lines of input, where each input line will be the scores for one
player.
The scores will be separated by one or more blanks. You may assume that
the number of scores on the line is valid.

</h3>
<p>Cobbletown has a lottery (a small version of California's Lotto) in
which players guess four number between 1 and 9. Larry likes to play
and thinks he has a scheme to pick winning numbers. He keeps a history
of past winning numbers in a text data file. Larry thinks that if a
number hasn't occurred recently then it is more likely to show up as a
winner. (Obviously Larry isn't familiar with the statistical fact that
each number has an equal likelihood of being picked, since each week's
drawing is an independent event). Larry wants us to write a program to
assist him in his wacky scheme.</p>
<p>INPUT REQUIREMENTS</p>
<dir>
<p> The lotto history data: a file of unknown length, with four
integers per line. Each integer is in the range 1 to 9.</p>
</dir>
<p>OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS</p>
<dir>
<p> 1. The four least frequently occurring integers in the history
data. (That is, counting all the weeks, the four numbers that appeared
fewer times than any others).</p>
<p> 2. The one integer with longest time since last occurrence. (That
is, if you count backward from now, the number for which you count the
most weeks since it occurred).</p>
</dir>
<p>FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p> (You may assume that no data validity checking is required).</p>
<dir>
1. Determine and display the four integers which occur least often in
the history data.
<p> Note: To make the problem easier, if there is a tie between two or
more numbers for fourth place, it doesn't matter which one is printed.</p>
<p>2. Determine and display the integer which has gone the longest
without appearing in a winning sequence.</p>

<h3 align="left"> Castles and Creatures</h3>
<p>
<table width="60%"><tbody><tr><td>
Write a program to play a simple "adventure"-style
interactive game.  The adventure world consists of up to five
castles each of which has up to seven rooms (35 total).
Each room has a treasure, worth a certain number of points, and
a creature guarding the treasure.  
The treasure can be captured by bluffing or fighting
the creature.  Bluffing always has a 30% chance of succeeding.
The odds for winning a fight vary from creature to 
creature. 
The object of the game is to visit different
rooms and gain as many treasure points 
as possible.  The player begins
with 9 lives and each fight lost costs a life.
(There's no penalty for losing a bluff.)
When all the lives (or all treasures) are gone
the game ends.
The adventure world information
(like castle and room names)
is stored in a text file.
The program must read the text file
and create a data structure to represent the world.
(HINT: Use a record structure for each room.)
The program must handle interaction with
the player, including display of menus for
castle and room choices, display of current lives
and treasure points accumulated, and
responding to one-character commands to
fight, bluff, or move around the world.
